## Intro

The interplay between artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience is a young and promising field. It has recently developed its own conference: [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience](https://ccneuro.org/). The goal of this course is to give you an introduction to this field. You will learn to answer questions like these:

- What types of (neural) models are there?
- How do they map onto behavior and brain activity?
- For what aspects of cognition do we have good models, and what others are lacking?

Although the field is a theoretical one, the course focuses much more on concepts than on mathematics. My aim is to give you basic insights into how models are made and what model-based science is, and then progress onto what the state of the art is in the field.

# Outline of the course

This course will feature lectures, practicals and discussions. Grading will be based on a final exam (50%), the practical assignments (25%), and participation in literature and podcast review (25%).

You can find the schedule for the course on [rooster.vu.nl](http://rooster.vu.nl).

Practical requirements for the course: 

1. you will need a Google account for accessing colaboratory notebooks
2. you will need to enroll in the [Perusall](http://www.perusall.com) mirror of this course, using the course code **KNAPEN-RCH83** upon registration
3. 

# Contact & Office hours

I can be contacted through email [tknapen@gmail.com](mailto:tknapen@gmail.com), but be sure to put ***[Neural Models]*** in the subject line to trigger my response as soon as possible.

As I work both at the VU and [Spinoza Centre (KNAW)](http://www.spinozacentre.nl) I am forced to divide my time between the two. For you this means that I will hold office hours on ***Mondays (13:00 to 14:00)*** and ***Fridays (11:00 ot 12:00)*** . I will try to be present in room ***MF C577-A*** during these timeslots, but if you really want to make sure I'm there, email me in advance.

# 1. Lectures

There will be one two-hour lecture per week, one for each of seven weeks. The lectures will not be recorded, but pdfs of the lectures will appear on canvas immediately *after* the lecture.

The lectures will introduce the material that will provide the basis of the practicals. We will start with the why of modeling, and work our way up from basic modeling of behavioral processes to more complicated neural models.

Final lectures, on the use of convolutional neural networks in cognitive neuroscience, will be held by guest lecturers. They will be introduced later on in the course.

# 2. Practicals

The practicals will be given in the format of jupyter notebooks, which you can run on [google colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/). Those of you that have already completed Brain Imaging will be familiar with the format.

The practicals are hosted on the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/tknapen/NMCP_AI_2020). There, you can navigate and open the notebooks in Colab by clicking the 'open in Colab' button and save them in your own Google Drive. 

### Getting started with Python

Some coding in python will be required to fully answer the questions and complete the assignments (but as most of you are AI students and the others have just completed a programming course you'll all be fine). [A starting guide notebook](https://canvas.vu.nl/files/1759934/download?wrap=1) has been created for you that want to practice your relevant coding skills (make sure to download the required files from the **Files** section). *This notebook will not be graded, but serves as a preparation to the course.* Those of you who have taken brain imaging earlier, will recognize the material and can skip it.

### Assignments

There will be 3 assignments, and you will have 2 weeks to finish each.

#### Some points on the practicals:

- Exercises must be completed and submitted individually.
- You should use the notebook format to make your answers readable.
- Bonus questions are bonus questions for a reason - skip them on your first pass.

# 3. Discussions based on BrainInspired podcasts

The field of Computational Cognitive Neuroscience is very young, meaning that the definitive guide to this field hasn't been written. Instead, one of the most interesting aggregations of information and viewpoints on this new field is in the format of a podcast: the [braininspired.co](http://braininspired.co) podcast. In this podcast, Paul Middlebrooks, who used to be an active researcher himself, interviews the biggest AI and neuroscientists in the field. What's nice about this format, is that these top-notch scientists explain the ins and outs of their respective fields in a very colloquial manner, which can give you, as a student, a gentle intro into a given subfield of computational cognitive neuroscience. In our course, we will use these podcast episodes as a starting point for our discussions and reading.

### The Format for Discussions

First, you will get together to decide on the specific podcast episode that you will cover. You can listen to a couple beforehand to get an idea and form an opinion on which you'd like to present about. After you have decided what to cover as a group, listen to the podcast episode, and make notes of the things that you find hard to understand, or concepts that were new to you. Look these topics up (Google/Wikipedia), and go through the shownotes (and specifically the literature referenced therein), which may clarify things (a lot!). It may help to focus on one of the shownote articles for focus. Then, listen to the podcast again, with your added knowledge.

**Important:** If, after going through both the podcast and the shownotes things are still unclear, you can always ask me for clarification [via email](mailto:tknapen@gmail.com) - remember to put ***[Neural Models]*** in the subject line!

After you have all listened to the podcast and read the supporting literature, it's time to get together as a group and create a presentation to be held in class, as fuel for dicussions. It's a good idea to keep to the following structure for the presentation, and create slides for each of these points:

1. Who is the interviewee and what is their field?
2. What is the work that prompted the interview?
3. Explain the main concepts in 1 or two slides.
4. How does this work bring together AI and Cognitive Neuroscience?
5. What are the open questions that remain?

Don't hold back - be opinionated in what you say in your presentation! Did you like the conversation, or not? Could you follow what the discussion was about? You are also free to use ample figures and pictures from the interviewee's website, wikipedia/scholarpedia and the literature that was attached to the podcast episode.

The first slide of the presentation needs to list your names and student numbers, and should be uploaded to canvas before the discussions lecture.

### Grading of Discussion format

Grades will be based on the intellectual content of the joint presentation, and its delivery (75%). Another 25% of your grade will be based on your participation in discussions based on other students' presentations.
