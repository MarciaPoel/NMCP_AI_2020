# Intro

The interplay between artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience is a young and promising field. It has recently developed its own conference: [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience](https://ccneuro.org/). The goal of this course is to give you an introduction to this field. You will learn to answer questions like these:

- What types of (neural) models are there?
- How do they map onto behavior and brain activity?
- For what aspects of cognition do we have good models, and what others are lacking?

Although the field is a theoretical one, the course focuses much more on concepts than on mathematics. My aim is to give you basic insights into how models are made and what model-based (neuro)science is, and then progress onto what the state of the art is in the field.

# Outline of the course

This course will feature ***lectures, practicals, literature review, and presentations***. Grading will be based on a final exam (33.3%), the practical assignments (33.3%), and participation in literature reading (16.6%) and podcast presentation (16.6%). Note that these percentages and the course content have been upgraded to be lockdown-proof, so they will be different from the original course summary on vunet. 

You can find the schedule for the course on [rooster.vu.nl](http://rooster.vu.nl).

Practical requirements for the course: 

1. you will need a Google account for accessing collaboratory notebooks
2. you will need to enroll in the [Perusall](http://www.perusall.com) mirror of this course, using the course code **KNAPEN-RCH83** upon registration

# Contact & Office hours

I can be contacted through email [tknapen@gmail.com](mailto:tknapen@gmail.com), but be sure to put ***[Neural Models]*** in the subject line to trigger my response as soon as possible.

As I work both at the VU and [Spinoza Centre (KNAW)](http://www.spinozacentre.nl) I divide my time between the two. For you this means that I will hold office hours on ***Mondays (11:00 to 12:00)*** and ***Fridays (11:00 ot 12:00)*** . These office hours will take place on Zoom: [Neural Models Office Hours Zoom Meeting](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84681767459). The password for this meeting will be given on Canvas. 

# 1. Lectures

There will be two two-hour lecture per week at the start of the course, and less by the end. During these first weeks I'll cover all the basics, after which the course focuses more on your own input. I'm aiming to give the lectures live via Zoom, but I'm expecting a son to be born on the date of the exam, which means that later on lectures may be recorded (and you can sleep in on Mondays and Fridays!). Recordings will be placed on Canvas after the lecture (for the Zoom ones), or whenever they are finished (for the pre-recorded ones).

The lectures will introduce the material that will provide the basis of the practicals. We will start with the why of modeling, and work our way up from basic modeling of behavioral processes to more complicated neural models.

Final lectures, on the use of convolutional neural networks in cognitive neuroscience, will be held by guest lecturers. They will be introduced later on in the course.

# 2. Practicals

The practicals will be given in the format of jupyter notebooks, which you can run on [google colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/). Those of you that have already completed Brain Imaging will be familiar with the format.

Detailed information on the Practicals is [here](practicals.md)

# 3. Reading literature on Perusall

As literature for the course, we have uploaded a set of articles that we think exemplify this young field of CCN. **The content of these articles is exam material.** We will jointly read these papers on [Perusall](http://www.perusall.com), an online collaborative reading platform. When you register, use the course code **KNAPEN-RCH83** to enroll in the Neural Models course. 

Perusall is meant to help you understand literature. You will all be reading the same papers, and will be able to ask and answer questions about the text. This platform allows us to see how you're all progressing with the reading, and provides a gauge on your participation. 

# 4. Presentations based on BrainInspired podcasts

The field of Computational Cognitive Neuroscience is very young, meaning that the definitive guide to this field hasn't been written. Instead, one of the most interesting aggregations of information and viewpoints on this new field is in the format of a podcast: the [braininspired.co](http://braininspired.co) podcast. In this podcast, Paul Middlebrooks, who used to be an active researcher himself, interviews the biggest AI and neuroscientists in the field. What's nice about this format, is that these top-notch scientists explain the ins and outs of their respective fields in a very colloquial manner, which can give you, as a student, a gentle intro into a given subfield of computational cognitive neuroscience. In our course, we will use these podcast episodes as a starting point for our discussions and reading.
