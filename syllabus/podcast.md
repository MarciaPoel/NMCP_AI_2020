# Discussions based on BrainInspired podcasts

The field of Computational Cognitive Neuroscience is very young, meaning that the definitive guide to this field hasn't been written. Instead, one of the most interesting aggregations of information and viewpoints on this new field is in the format of a podcast: the [braininspired.co](http://braininspired.co) podcast. In this podcast, Paul Middlebrooks, who used to be an active researcher himself, interviews the biggest AI and neuroscientists in the field. What's nice about this format, is that these top-notch scientists explain the ins and outs of their respective fields in a very colloquial manner, which can give you, as a student, a gentle intro into a given subfield of computational cognitive neuroscience. In our course, we will use these podcast episodes as a starting point for our discussions.

## The Format for Discussions

You will be divided into small groups of 4-5 students. Part of the work for the discussions is done by yourself, such as listening to the podcast, etc. Other parts, such as making the required presentation, have to be done together.

First, you will get together to decide on the specific podcast episode that you will cover. You can listen to a couple beforehand to get an idea and form an opinion on which you'd like to present about. After you have decided what to cover as a group, listen to the podcast episode, and make notes of the things that you find hard to understand, or concepts that were new to you. Look these topics up (Google/Wikipedia), and go through the shownotes (and specifically the literature referenced therein), which may clarify things (a lot!). It may help to focus on one of the shownote articles for focus. Then, listen to the podcast again, with your added knowledge.

**Important:** If, after going through both the podcast and the shownotes things are still unclear, you can always ask me for clarification [via email](mailto:tknapen@gmail.com) - remember to put ***[Neural Models]*** in the subject line!

After you have all listened to the podcast and read the supporting literature, it's time to get together as a group and create a presentation to be held in class, as fuel for dicussions. It's a good idea to keep to the following structure for the presentation, and create slides for each of these points:

1. Who is the interviewee and what is their field?
2. What is the work that prompted the interview?
3. Explain the main concepts in 1 or two slides.
4. How does this work bring together AI and Cognitive Neuroscience?
5. What are the open questions that remain?

Don't hold back - be opinionated in what you say in your presentation! Did you like the conversation, or not? Could you follow what the discussion was about? You are also free to use ample figures and pictures from the interviewee's website, wikipedia/scholarpedia and the literature that was attached to the podcast episode.

The first slide of the presentation needs to list your names and student numbers, and should be uploaded to canvas before the discussions lecture.

### Grading

Grades will be based on the intellectual content of the joint presentation, and its delivery (75%). Another 25% of your grade will be based on your participation in discussions based on other students' presentations.
