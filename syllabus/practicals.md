# Practicals 

The practicals are hosted on the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/tknapen/NMCP_AI_2020). You can navigate and open the notebooks in Colab by clicking the 'open in Colab' buttons below. Make sure to copy them to your own Google Drive. If you want to know more about Colab, see the ["Welcome to Colab" Website](https://colab.research.google.com)

### Getting started with Python

Some coding in python will be required to fully answer the questions and complete the assignments (but as most of you are AI students and the others have just completed a programming course you'll all be fine). has been created for you that want to practice your relevant coding skills (make sure to download the required files from the GitHub repo too). *This notebook will not be graded, but serves as a preparation to the course.* Those of you who have taken brain imaging earlier, will recognize the material and can skip it.

### Assignments

There will be 3 assignments, and you will have 2 weeks to finish each.

1. Practical 1: SDT and decision-making models [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tknapen/NMCP_AI_2020/blob/main/practicals/practical_1.ipynb)
2. Practical 2: Q-learning model for reinforcement learning, and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tknapen/NMCP_AI_2020/blob/main/practicals/practical_2.ipynb)
3. Practical 3: Backpropagation, Perceptrons, and modelling of attention [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tknapen/NMCP_AI_2020/blob/main/practicals/practical_3.ipynb)

You will have to submit these assignments on Canvas, and will have 2 weeks time for all assignments.

#### Some points on the practicals:

- Exercises must be completed and submitted individually.
- You should use the notebook's markdown formatting effectively to make your answers readable. 
- Bonus questions are bonus questions for a reason - skip them on your first pass.
