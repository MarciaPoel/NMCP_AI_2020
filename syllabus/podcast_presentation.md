# Podcast presentation

## The Format for Presentations

First, you will decide on the specific podcast episode that you will cover. You can listen to a couple beforehand to get an idea and form an opinion on which you'd like to present about. After you have decided which podcast to cover, listen to the podcast episode, and make notes of the things that you find hard to understand, or concepts that were new to you. Look these topics up (Google/Wikipedia), and go through the shownotes (and specifically the literature referenced therein), which may clarify things (a lot!). It may help to focus on one of the shownote articles for focus. Then, listen to the podcast again, with your added knowledge.

**Important:** If, after going through both the podcast and the shownotes things are still unclear, you can always ask me for clarification [via email](mailto:tknapen@gmail.com) - remember to put ***[Neural Models]*** in the subject line!

After you have listened to the podcast and read the supporting literature, it's time to create a presentation. Each of you will be required to create a 6-minute recording of your presentation, and upload this on canvas. It's a good idea to keep to the following structure for the presentation, and create slides for each of these points:

1. Who is the interviewee and what is their field?
2. What is the work that prompted the interview?
3. Explain the main concepts in 1 or two slides.
4. How does this work bring together AI and Cognitive Neuroscience?
5. What are the open questions that remain?

Don't hold back - be opinionated in what you say in your presentation! Did you like the conversation, or not? Could you follow what the discussion was about? You are also free to use ample figures and pictures from the interviewee's website, wikipedia/scholarpedia and the literature that was attached to the podcast episode.

The first slide of the presentation needs to list your names and student number, and should be uploaded to canvas before the discussions lecture.

## Recording of your presentation

You will also have to upload a 6-minute recording of your presentation. Many of you will be new to this recording of presentations. Some tips; I've found [OBS](https://obsproject.com) a very handy tool to create lively recordings of presentations. Since you don't have too much time, it helps to practice your presentation a couple of times. Also, since you have limited time, visualizations help in speeding up your flow. 

## Grading of Discussion format

Grades will be based on the intellectual content of the joint presentation, and its delivery. You will be asked to review 5 other presentations, and grade them according to the rubric listed on Canvas. Please also consult this Rubric if you're wondering what is important to get right.
